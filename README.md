## Class Work
The classWork folder is filled with programs/Max patches written throughout the semester for Algorithmic Composition, these programs sandbox the use of Max objects to implement fundamentals of music composition.

## Compositions
The compositions folder contains a Stochastic, Deterministic, Interactive, and Stochastic-Interactive hybrid composition.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../lorem
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
